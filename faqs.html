                <button class="faq-question">Where are you based?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We are based in Marikina. We are constantly on the road, shooting weddings all over the country. So it is worth asking where we are around the time of your wedding. You never know, we might be in your area!</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">When will I receive my photographs?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You will expect to receive your edited photos around 6-8 weeks after the wedding. We send out the photo package containing your images to your address usually 2 weeks after that. If you have ordered an album, it will take up to 6 months for printing after it is complete.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">What do we receive?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You will receive the images that we have carefully selected, edited and finished (approximately 300-500 images depending how long we shoot and how jam-packed your wedding day is). The photos will be ready for print, so you can print your photos as many times as you want. All the images are on a custom wooden USB drive, with an intricate box to keep the whole package!</p>

            <li class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">We don't really like wedding photos where the couple are posing and forcing the smiling in every photo. We like the natural candid photos a lot more!</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We feel the same way. We won't be making you smile for every photo. In fact you won't notice that we are there for most of the day. When it comes to the couple's portraits, we can give enough direction so you feel comfortable and not to much so you are still looking very natural.</p>

            <li class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">Do you prefer flash photography or natural light?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We love natural light! Natural light helps preserve the real mood and feeling at the wedding. We love using the light that we have to make the best of a situation. Of course we use flash when it gets too dark at night.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">I'm really keen to book, but I live outside Metro Manila. Will you travel this far?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely. We love travel so much. We have been all over the Philippines and out of the countries as well.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How much is the reservation fee? Is it refundable and how quick will I have to pay it?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It is advisable to pay the reservation fee as soon as you make your final decision. This secures the date for your booking. The reservation fee is P5,000 and is non refundable.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Can I purchase an Album after the wedding day?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes of course! You can purchase an album at any time. A lot of our clients order their album for Christmas or on their first year anniversary.</p>
